# Goals

Goals for the FiveDice experiment.


## Core goals

- A functional app usable on mobile phones where a player can:
    - See the lobby with available games to join
    - Can join an existing game
    - Can, create a game
    - Will wait for others to join before allowing to start making turns
    - Can play with others, see their gambles, etc.
    - If player lost, can continue to observe the game until its conclusion
    - Can quit a game at any time
    - Can watch other games in progress
- Has a handful of legitimate unit tests (ie: not, expect(true).toBe(true))


## Stretch goals (in any order)

- Support for i18n via Jed.js or similar.
- Experiment with alternate libraries and frameworks
    - Knockout.js
    - A mobile UI CSS framework, eg: Bootstrap 3.
- Support for l10n, check out https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/i18n for
  inspiration
